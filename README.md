# MP3-Player-NP
MP3 Player Desktop application based on Java Swing 
	
In this Jframe window, we added the main JPanel then inserted three more JPanels. In first sub panel we put JLabel and set its title to MP3 Player and Close button. In next panel we put the name of currently playing song. And in the last panel we added all the JButtons to perform different operations. Those buttons are as given below:

1] Play Button: To play the mp3 file. It calls the MP3Player.play() method.

2] Pause Button: To pause the currently playing 
music file. It calls the MP3Player.pause() method.

3] Stop Button: To stop the current file. It calls 
MP3Player.stop() method. 

4] Mute Button: To mute the volume but music 
Keeps playing continue. We add the mouseClicked() 
Method and called volumeControl() method. 

5] Audio Plus: To increase the audio volume. It 
Calls the  volumeUpControl() method.

6] Audio Minus: To decrease the audio volume. It 
Calls the  volumeDownControl() method. 

7] Close Button: To close the window. It calls the 
Dispose() method.
